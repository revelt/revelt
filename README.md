ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Roy. I like to write and maintain Open Source JS/TS programs. Also I like to lift, to draw and to drink beer but who does not?

ðŸ”­ My flagship projects are:

- [`email-comb`](https://codsen.com/os/email-comb) â€” removes unused CSS from mixed-source HTML (templating languages etc) (see the [GUI](https://emailcomb.com))
- [`html-crush`](https://codsen.com/os/html-crush) â€” minifies HTML, also supports mixed-source HTML, has special features for email templates (see the [GUI](https://htmlcrush.com))
- [`detergent`](https://codsen.com/os/detergent) â€” all-in-one tool to prepare text for copy-pasting into HTML â€” invisible character cleaner, encoder and English style fixer (see the [GUI](https://detergent.io))
- [`codsen-tokenizer`](https://codsen.com/os/codsen-tokenizer) â€” a lexer aimed at parsing really broken code, HTML/CSS/comments/ESP tags
- [`codsen-parser`](https://codsen.com/os/codsen-parser) â€” a parser on top of `codsen-tokenizer`, builds AST's from tokens
- last but not least, [`emlint`](https://codsen.com/os/emlint) â€” email template linter â€” aim is to find and detect email template rendering bugs while editing code

There are around 120 [open source packages](https://codsen.com/os) on npm, a dozen of them are CLI's, some of them even with [playgrounds](https://codsen.com/os/play). I'm co-maintainer of a few more.

ðŸ’¼ Codsen

Codsen Ltd. is my personal company through which I used to contract before UK's IR35 and Covid happened. It's the opposite of "normal" companies out there, zero open source but max income â€” we've got max open source and zero income ðŸ˜‚. I guess being able to work purely on passion projects, disregarding the monetisation, helps. For example, `emlint` is impossible to monetize, like any other linters, notably Mr. Crockford's `jslint`. He was the first. There is a huge void space â€” programs humanity needs but which are hard to make and impossible to monetize. Oh well.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go and backend Node.js
