ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Roy. I like to tinker with Open Source programs, mostly in Node.js ecosytem.

ðŸ”­ My main projects are:

- [`email-comb`](https://codsen.com/os/email-comb) â€” removes unused CSS, uglifies ([GUI](https://emailcomb.com))
- [`html-crush`](https://codsen.com/os/html-crush) â€” mixed HTML minifier (see the [GUI](https://htmlcrush.com))
- [`detergent`](https://codsen.com/os/detergent) â€” invisible character cleaner, encoder and style fixer ([GUI](https://detergent.io))
- also, [`emlint`](https://codsen.com/os/emlint) â€” email template linter â€” the aim is to find and detect email template rendering bugs during coding, before sending tests to _Email on Acid_ or _Litmus_. Currently work-in-progress.

I also wrote a [json preprocessor](https://codsen.com/os/json-variables), positionally-stable [uglifier](https://codsen.com/os/string-uglify/) for CSS classes/id's, and a _string-in-string-out_ non-parsing [HTML stripping](https://codsen.com/os/string-strip-html/) tool, also bunch of CLI's and other small programs.

Have a look! Thanks for visiting.
