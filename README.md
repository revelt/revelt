üëã Hi! I'm Roy, I'm from UK üá¨üáß. All my Open Source projects are published under GitHub [codsen](https://github.com/codsen) org account, not here. Here you'll see mostly forks which I haven't bothered to delete yet.

üî≠ I wrote and maintain a broad spectrum of Open Source programs, for example:

- A big, CPU-bound program: [`detergent`](https://codsen.com/os/detergent), [`email-comb`](https://codsen.com/os/email-comb)
- Exports...
	- Both sync and async methods: [`json-comb-core`](https://codsen.com/os/json-comb-core)
	- A regex: [`regex-empty-conditional-comments`](https://codsen.com/os/regex-empty-conditional-comments)	
	- A `Set`: [`html-entities-not-email-friendly`](https://codsen.com/os/html-entities-not-email-friendly)
	- CSS as string: [`generate-atomic-css`](https://codsen.com/os/generate-atomic-css)
	- `2^n` combinations of plain options object boolean values for unit tests: [`test-mixer`](https://codsen.com/os/test-mixer)
- Scannerless parser algorithm, processing the...
	- HTML: [`html-crush`](https://codsen.com/os/html-crush)
	- CSS: [`string-extract-sass-vars`](https://codsen.com/os/string-extract-sass-vars)
	- JSON: [`edit-package-json`](https://codsen.com/os/edit-package-json)
	- TypeScript: [`tsd-extract`](https://codsen.com/os/tsd-extract)
	- CSV: [`csv-split-easy`](https://codsen.com/os/csv-split-easy)
	- Commitizen-generated `CHANGELOG.md`: [`lerna-clean-changelogs`](https://codsen.com/os/lerna-clean-changelogs)
	- human prose: [`string-apostrophes`](https://codsen.com/os/string-apostrophes)
- Variety of program API styles:
	- Classes-based API: [`ranges-push`](https://codsen.com/os/ranges-push)
	- Callback-only API: [`ast-monkey-traverse-with-lookahead`](https://codsen.com/os/ast-monkey-traverse-with-lookahead)
	- (One of a dozen) CLI: [`csv-sort-cli`](https://codsen.com/os/csv-sort-cli)
- Stripping parsed tokens from HTML/CSS: [`stristri`](https://codsen.com/os/stristri) ‚Äî done by traversing AST directly from [a tokenizer](https://codsen.com/os/codsen-tokenizer) ‚Äî but we have an own AST traversing program too: [üêí `ast-monkey`](https://codsen.com/os/ast-monkey)
- Parser, which produces our custom-design AST: [`codsen-parser`](https://codsen.com/os/codsen-parser)
- Plugins:
	- Gulp plugin: [`gulp-email-remove-unused-css`](https://codsen.com/os/gulp-email-remove-unused-css)
	- ESLint plugin: [`eslint-plugin-row-num`](https://codsen.com/os/eslint-plugin-row-num)
- File streams: [`tap-parse-string-to-object`](https://codsen.com/os/tap-parse-string-to-object)
- _Observer pattern_ using Node's `EventEmmitter`: [`emlint`](https://codsen.com/os/emlint)
- Fetches values from the internet: [`update-versions`](https://codsen.com/os/update-versions)
- Unicode astral character-aware: [`easy-replace`](https://codsen.com/os/easy-replace)
- IANA specs turned into a program: [`is-language-code`](https://codsen.com/os/is-language-code)
- Backwards-engineering a 3rd party API: [`bitbucket-slug`](https://codsen.com/os/bitbucket-slug)
- Recursion: [`ast-monkey-traverse`](https://codsen.com/os/ast-monkey-traverse)
- Normalising the perf benchmark scores against a mock program: [`perf-ref`](https://codsen.com/os/perf-ref)
- String uglifier based on cryptography principles: [`string-uglify`](https://codsen.com/os/string-uglify)
- Reduce but over promises: [`json-comb`](https://codsen.com/os/json-comb) (surprisingly a common pattern, used by CLI's which read multiple files in async)

See the full list on [codsen.com/os/](https://codsen.com/os)

All the above was done outside 9‚Äì5 work hours, and many people (including me) use them in production, during 9‚Äì5.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è programming because I can create things and because my programs empower people to build even greater programs and to perform business tasks and get paid and feed their families.

Thanks for visiting!
