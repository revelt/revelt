ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Roy. All my Open Source projects are published under GitHub [codsen](https://github.com/codsen) org account, not here. Here you'll see mostly cheeky forks which should have been deleted by now.

ðŸ”­ My main projects are:

- [`email-comb`](https://codsen.com/os/email-comb) â€” removes unused CSS, uglifies ([GUI](https://emailcomb.com))
- [`html-crush`](https://codsen.com/os/html-crush) â€” mixed HTML minifier ([GUI](https://htmlcrush.com))
- [`detergent`](https://codsen.com/os/detergent) â€” invisible character cleaner, encoder and English style fixer ([GUI](https://detergent.io))

See the list of all Open Source packages [here](https://codsen.com/os/).

Thanks for visiting!
