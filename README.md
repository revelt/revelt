ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Roy.

ðŸ”­ My flagship projects are:

- [`email-comb`](https://codsen.com/os/email-comb) â€” removes unused CSS, uglifies ([GUI](https://emailcomb.com))
- [`html-crush`](https://codsen.com/os/html-crush) â€” mixed HTML minifier (see the [GUI](https://htmlcrush.com))
- [`detergent`](https://codsen.com/os/detergent) â€” invisible character cleaner, encoder and style fixer ([GUI](https://detergent.io))
- last but not least, [`emlint`](https://codsen.com/os/emlint) â€” email template linter â€” the aim is to find and detect email template rendering bugs during coding, before sending tests to _Email on Acid_ or _Litmus_. Currently work-in-progress.

I created and maintain around 120 [open source packages](https://codsen.com/os) on npm, a dozen of them are CLI's, some of them even with [playgrounds](https://codsen.com/os/play). See the TS-Lerna monorepo at Github [Codsen's org space](https://github.com/codsen/codsen).

ðŸ’¼ Codsen

[Codsen Ltd.](https://codsen.com) is my personal company through which I used to contract before UK's IR35 and Covid happened. Currently it's more of an Open Source brand.
